I am currently a doctoral candidate in Second Language Studies at Michigan State University (MSU). I was a teacher of English as a foreign language in Hong Kong for seven years. I received my Master’s degree from the University of Oxford, and Bachelor’s degrees from the University of Hong Kong. I have also been a golfer and a runner. I am currently training for my first marathon.
